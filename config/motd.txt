Its a dick move, don't randomly kill other people.

<h3>Do not mess with the SSD</h3>
If someone is logged out, do not touch them. Exceptions are made if they combat log or arrest log. If you are a Traitor and your target goes SSD, Ahelp it.

<h3>Do not Ban Evade</h3>
This will cause us to ban you even more.

<h3>Know that this is a Medium RP server.</h3>
We do not require everyone to be fully immersed, with Character records and fully done flavor texts, but they are nice to have. Keep yourself within the RP, do not break it.
